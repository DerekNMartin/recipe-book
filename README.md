# Recipe Book

Built to catalog all the recipes my partner and I have cooked and enjoyed - without the nonsense.

Various recipe website are either behind a paywall, clogged by advertisements, and/or include endless paragraphs of drivel for SEO purposes.
We just wanted a place to store our favourite recipes, so they're easy to find and come back to.
